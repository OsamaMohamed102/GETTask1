Using Selenium/Java Tool , maven and different framkeworks like testng and cucmber i have built my code to test registeration page
And i have used different design patterns like "POM" in writing my code
 
i have worked on the registertion form that was in the mail


 i have used xpath and id locator.It's More Accurate
I have used different selenium commands to earn your trust
and finally in runner class is to ""create report after test"".
and you will find screenshot for the report

and in manual testing i have used excel to wirte my testcases and bug report in details i tried to avoid open source testing tool
i can use it but i wanted to write it in details.


and i hope you find it useful.
Thanks.
